However, in contrast to his mother, Yuu is completely talentless. Being seen as completely mediocre, he would have no chance of standing side by side with the three emperors of Saika Academy: the Mikadono sisters, Miwa, Nico, and Kazuki, who are each prodigies in shogi, martial arts, and performing arts, respectively.\n\nWith Subaru's friend agreeing to take her son in, Yuu aims to fulfill his mother's last wish to him, which is to build a happy family, after never being able to form a proper mother-son relationship due to their difference in talent. As it turns out, his mother's friend is actually the father of the Mikadono sisters! Keeping his mother's wish in mind, Yuu aims to build familial bonds with the siblings. However, due to their extreme focus on their respective specializations, they show little interest in opening themselves up not only to him, but to each other as well. Nonetheless, Yuu strives to continuously support the three prodigies, as his kindness and care restores the bond between the sisters.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"summer","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":306,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Capsule","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/306/Magic_Capsule"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1430,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"},{"mal_id":1501,"type":"anime","name":"JR East Marketing & Communications","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1501/JR_East_Marketing___Communications"},{"mal_id":1986,"type":"anime","name":"arma bianca","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1986/arma_bianca"},{"mal_id":2680,"type":"anime","name":"Sankyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2680/Sankyo_"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":132,"type":"anime","name":"P.A.

The Oni are careless, rash, and disorderly, while the Momotarou protect the human world from the uncontrollable Oni. Shiki Ichinose is a reckless and irresponsible teenager, aware of his defiance and even proud of his expulsion from school. Despite Shiki's rebellious attitude, his foster father, Tsuyoshi, cares about him deeply.\n\nTsuyoshi's selfless love is soon shown in an explosive incident when a Momotarou barges in looking for Shiki. As a Momotarou himself, Tsuyoshi has been hiding Shiki for years and keeping his Oni origins a secret even from him. As he gives up his life to save Shiki and confesses everything in his dying breath, Shiki's Oni blood awakens for the first time, transforming him into an unruly monster overflowing with rage and a thirst for revenge.\n\nShiki's momentary outburst attracts the attention of Naito Mudano, an Oni teacher at the Rakshasa Academy—an institution for young Oni in need of understanding and perfecting their powers. Before Shiki can avenge his father, he must learn to control his headstrong and impulsive nature and, above all, fight against his own demonic blood.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Tougen Anki aired on Nippon TV's Friday Anime Night block.","season":"summer","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":1003,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Television Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"},{"mal_id":1373,"type":"anime","name":"Akita Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1373/Akita_Shoten"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":101,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Hibari","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/101/Studio_Hibari"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":60732,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/60732/Mizu_Zokusei_no_Mahoutsukai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1383/151072.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1383/151072t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1383/151072l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1383/151072.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1383/151072t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1383/151072l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"4E6zDMwB1rw","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E6zDMwB1rw","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4E6zDMwB1rw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4E6zDMwB1rw/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4E6zDMwB1rw/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4E6zDMwB1rw/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4E6zDMwB1rw/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4E6zDMwB1rw/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Mizu Zokusei no Mahoutsukai"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Water Magician: The Central Provinces Arc"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Mizu Zokusei no Mahoutsukai Daiichibu: Chuuou Shokoku-hen"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"水属性の魔法使い"},{"type":"English","title":"The Water Magician"}],"title":"Mizu Zokusei no Mahoutsukai","title_english":"The Water Magician","title_japanese":"水属性の魔法使い","title_synonyms":["The Water Magician: The Central Provinces Arc","Mizu Zokusei no Mahoutsukai Daiichibu: Chuuou Shokoku-hen"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":null,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2025-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":7,"year":2025},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 4, 2025 to ?"},"duration":"24 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.19,"scored_by":12903,"rank":3527,"popularity":2498,"members":87361,"favorites":268,"synopsis":"Ryou is delighted to be reincarnated into the fantastical world of Phi, where he thinks he'll get to live a quiet life learning to use his newfound water magic.

The dubs were close to the original but had seen some censorship. The English dubbed version by Funimation was produced in 2005, featuring a Texas-based cast of voice actors, and was altered in comparison to the original—sexual references, dark humor, and references to popular American culture were added later on. Additionally, many non-existent backstories and different personalities were created.

In order to restore the fragile harmony, kashi—gifted dancers and singers—must hunt the missing gods in other realms, use their performance skills to charm the deities, and seal them using the power of their rosaries.\n\nAlthough a master dancer, Ichiyou is ridiculed by his peers for his lack of singing talent. Nonetheless, the young kashi is tasked by the Eight Immortals to bring back the Four Perils before the world plunges into complete chaos. Helped by his familiars Tenkou and Kaka, Ichiyou embarks on the perilous mission given to him, with his search leading him to modern-day Japan. If he hopes to save the world, Ichiyou must also uncover the truth behind the Four Perils' disappearance—but this event seems to be disturbingly intertwined with his own past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The broadcast was delayed following the seventh episode on November 18, 2024, and was resumed in July 2025.","season":"fall","year":2024,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":61,"type":"anime","name":"Frontier Works","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"},{"mal_id":323,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Columbia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"},{"mal_id":1255,"type":"anime","name":"Glovision","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1255/Glovision"},{"mal_id":1492,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri TV Enterprise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"},{"mal_id":1582,"type":"anime","name":"Ichijinsha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1582/Ichijinsha"},{"mal_id":1986,"type":"anime","name":"arma bianca","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1986/arma_bianca"},{"mal_id":2289,"type":"anime","name":"GREE Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2289/GREE_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1340,"type":"anime","name":"Typhoon Graphics","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1340/Typhoon_Graphics"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":43,"type":"anime","name":"Josei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}]},{"mal_id":60315,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/60315/Dekin_no_Mogura","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/149311.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/149311t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/149311l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/149311.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/149311t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/149311l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"Vomd4o9lNXU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vomd4o9lNXU","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vomd4o9lNXU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Vomd4o9lNXU/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Vomd4o9lNXU/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Vomd4o9lNXU/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Vomd4o9lNXU/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/Vomd4o9lNXU/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Dekin no Mogura"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"出禁のモグラ"},{"type":"English","title":"Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole"}],"title":"Dekin no Mogura","title_english":"Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole","title_japanese":"出禁のモグラ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2025-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":7,"year":2025},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 7, 2025 to ?"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.17,"scored_by":1730,"rank":9196,"popularity":5726,"members":16147,"favorites":36,"synopsis":"Mogura, a mysterious \"self-proclaimed sage\" also known as Mogura Momoyuki, has been banned from the afterlife.

After moving in with his aunt, Kyouko Misaki, he prepares to spend the summer helping her sort through a shed full of artifacts his grandmother collected over the years alongside his cousin, Umi Katou, who is staying with them.\n\nWhile adjusting to the island's slower pace, Hairi decides to spend his free time exploring. He soon meets the cheerful Tsumugi Wenders; the antisocial Shiroha Naruse; the wandering Kamome Kushima; and the sharp-tongued Ao Sorakado. Drawn into their lives and the island's subtle mysteries, Hairi is gradually swept up in a summer filled with fun, nostalgia, and life-changing moments that will stay with him forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Summer Pockets is an adaptation of the 2018 visual novel of the same title developed by Key.","season":"spring","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"23:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 23:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":203,"type":"anime","name":"Visual Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/203/Visual_Arts"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":775,"type":"anime","name":"Bushiroad","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/775/Bushiroad"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1501,"type":"anime","name":"JR East Marketing & Communications","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1501/JR_East_Marketing___Communications"},{"mal_id":1590,"type":"anime","name":"FuRyu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1590/FuRyu"},{"mal_id":1800,"type":"anime","name":"Marui Group","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1800/Marui_Group"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":91,"type":"anime","name":"feel.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/91/feel"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]}]},"h":{},"s":200,"st":"OK","u":"https://api.jikan.moe/v4/schedules","rt":"json"},"3170504929":{"b":{"pagination":{"last_visible_page":1,"has_next_page":false,"current_page":1,"items":{"count":24,"total":24,"per_page":25}},"data":[{"mal_id":38776,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38776/Manul_no_Yuube","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1980/96936.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1980/96936t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1980/96936l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1980/96936.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1980/96936t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1980/96936l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Manul no Yuube"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"マヌ～ルのゆうべ"}],"title":"Manul no Yuube","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"マヌ～ルのゆうべ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Web manga","episodes":null,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2018-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":11,"month":11,"year":2018},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Nov 11, 2018 to ?"},"duration":"1 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":20506,"popularity":14484,"members":1048,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"Within the nature \"Darwin Kita!

This is a fun-loving and enjoyable anime that portrays the simple things in life.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":"","season":"winter","year":1995,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Ajia-do","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/30/Ajia-do"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":611,"type":"anime","name":"Sakura Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/611/Sakura_Production"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/22/Nippon_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":2406,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2406/Sazae-san","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1008/98996.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1008/98996t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1008/98996l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1008/98996.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1008/98996t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1008/98996l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Sazae-san"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"サザエさん"},{"type":"English","title":"Mrs. Sazae"}],"title":"Sazae-san","title_english":"Mrs. Sazae","title_japanese":"サザエさん","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"4-koma manga","episodes":null,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"1969-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":10,"year":1969},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Oct 5, 1969 to ?"},"duration":"24 min","rating":"G - All Ages","score":6.15,"scored_by":1974,"rank":9305,"popularity":6948,"members":10038,"favorites":40,"synopsis":"The main character is a mother named Sazae-san.

Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults. \n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":"Sazae-san currently holds the Guinness World Record for the longest running animated television series.","season":"fall","year":1969,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"18:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 18:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":191,"type":"anime","name":"Eiken","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/191/Eiken"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":60260,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/60260/Hotel_Inhumans","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1900/150443.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1900/150443t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1900/150443l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1900/150443.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1900/150443t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1900/150443l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"zfthL1m2GFg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfthL1m2GFg","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zfthL1m2GFg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfthL1m2GFg/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfthL1m2GFg/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfthL1m2GFg/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfthL1m2GFg/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfthL1m2GFg/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hotel Inhumans"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ホテル・インヒューマンズ"},{"type":"English","title":"Hotel Inhumans"}],"title":"Hotel Inhumans","title_english":"Hotel Inhumans","title_japanese":"ホテル・インヒューマンズ","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Web manga","episodes":13,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2025-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":7,"year":2025},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 6, 2025 to ?"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.51,"scored_by":1975,"rank":7217,"popularity":5740,"members":16022,"favorites":30,"synopsis":"Ikurou Hoshi and Sara Haizaki are the concierges at Hotel Inhumans, a hotel that specifically caters to assassins.

However, as Gojou spends more time with Kitagawa and realizes that his passions are not ridiculed by other people, a relationship between the two no longer seems so far-fetched.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"summer","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1835,"type":"anime","name":"CloverWorks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1835/CloverWorks"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":69,"type":"anime","name":"Otaku Culture","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":21,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/21/One_Piece","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"-tviZNY6CSw","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tviZNY6CSw","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-tviZNY6CSw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-tviZNY6CSw/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-tviZNY6CSw/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-tviZNY6CSw/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-tviZNY6CSw/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-tviZNY6CSw/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"One Piece"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"OP"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ONE PIECE"},{"type":"English","title":"One Piece"}],"title":"One Piece","title_english":"One Piece","title_japanese":"ONE PIECE","title_synonyms":["OP"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":null,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"1999-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":20,"month":10,"year":1999},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Oct 20, 1999 to ?"},"duration":"24 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.73,"scored_by":1459358,"rank":51,"popularity":17,"members":2565160,"favorites":241530,"synopsis":"Barely surviving in a barrel after passing through a terrible whirlpool at sea, carefree Monkey D.

The airing time was Wednesdays 19:00 between October 20, 1999 - March 2001. The airing time was changed to Sundays 19:30 between April 2001 - December 2004. The airing time was changed to Sundays 9:30 between October 6, 2006 - October 13, 2024. The airing time was again changed to Sundays 23:15 on April 6, 2025. Several anime-original arcs have been adapted into light novels, and the series has inspired 50+ video games as of 2023. In June 2004, One Piece was licensed in North America by 4Kids Entertainment, which partnered with Viz Media for home video distribution. As One Piece proved unsuitable for their target demographic, 4Kids Entertainment censored the show to meet their standards, and, in December 2006, they stopped its production. In April 2007, Funimation took over the series licensing, providing an uncut version that remained faithful to the original release. In Japan, the anime's first 574 episodes were released exclusively on DVD by Avex Pictures from February 21, 2001, to December 4, 2013. Blu-rays also became available with the DVDs starting on January 8, 2014. In North America, Viz Media released the anime on DVD between February 28, 2006, and June 26, 2007. Funimation has re-released and continued the series since May 27, 2008. From March 23, 2021, the DVDs were accompanied by Blu-rays as well.","season":"fall","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"23:15","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 23:15 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":416,"type":"anime","name":"TAP","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/416/TAP"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":252,"type":"anime","name":"4Kids Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/252/4Kids_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}]},"h":{},"s":200,"st":"OK","u":"https://api.jikan.moe/v4/schedules","rt":"json"},"4009195864":{"b":{"pagination":{"last_visible_page":1,"has_next_page":false,"current_page":1,"items":{"count":18,"total":18,"per_page":25}},"data":[{"mal_id":60070,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/60070/Kaijuu_Sekai_Seifuku_TV","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/150123.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/150123t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/150123l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/150123.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/150123t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/150123l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"YUQywis1jEk","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUQywis1jEk","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUQywis1jEk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YUQywis1jEk/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YUQywis1jEk/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YUQywis1jEk/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YUQywis1jEk/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YUQywis1jEk/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kaijuu Sekai Seifuku (TV)"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"かいじゅうせかいせいふく"}],"title":"Kaijuu Sekai Seifuku (TV)","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"かいじゅうせかいせいふく","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Web manga","episodes":null,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2025-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":4,"year":2025},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Apr 5, 2025 to ?"},"duration":"2 min","rating":"G -

Anne settles into her new life, experiencing many things for the first time—such as attending school and making close friends—as she learns to navigate the joys and challenges of growing up.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"spring","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"18:25","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 18:25 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":769,"type":"anime","name":"Fujipacific Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/769/Fujipacific_Music"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":229,"type":"anime","name":"The Answer Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/229/The_Answer_Studio"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":59277,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/59277/Kanojo_Okarishimasu_4th_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1071/150808.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1071/150808t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1071/150808l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1071/150808.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1071/150808t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1071/150808l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"VC226h0ivYg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC226h0ivYg","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VC226h0ivYg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/VC226h0ivYg/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/VC226h0ivYg/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/VC226h0ivYg/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/VC226h0ivYg/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/VC226h0ivYg/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kanojo, Okarishimasu 4th Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Kanokari"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"彼女、お借りします 第4期"},{"type":"English","title":"Rent-a-Girlfriend Season 4"}],"title":"Kanojo, Okarishimasu 4th Season","title_english":"Rent-a-Girlfriend Season 4","title_japanese":"彼女、お借りします 第4期","title_synonyms":["Kanokari"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2025-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2025-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":7,"year":2025},"to":{"day":20,"month":9,"year":2025}},"string":"Jul 5, 2025 to Sep 20, 2025"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.18,"scored_by":6742,"rank":9143,"popularity":2904,"members":68135,"favorites":313,"synopsis":"Fourth season of Kanojo, Okarishimasu.","background":"Each episode was streamed four days in advance of the TV broadcast from July 1, 2025 on DMM TV, d-anime Store, and Crunchyroll.

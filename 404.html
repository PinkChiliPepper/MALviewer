Even so, he still has a lot to learn, and every new lesson seems to strengthen his love for sewing and for the hina dolls his grandfather taught him to make.\n\nMeanwhile, Kitagawa finds it harder and harder to hide her feelings for Gojou. Friends and strangers alike constantly mistake them for a couple, much to Gojou's embarrassment. After all, in his eyes, their worlds are far too different for anyone to think they could be romantically linked. However, as Gojou spends more time with Kitagawa and realizes that his passions are not ridiculed by other people, a relationship between the two no longer seems so far-fetched.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"summer","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1835,"type":"anime","name":"CloverWorks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1835/CloverWorks"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":69,"type":"anime","name":"Otaku Culture","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":59845,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/59845/Kaoru_Hana_wa_Rin_to_Saku","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1744/150433.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1744/150433t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1744/150433l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1744/150433.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1744/150433t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1744/150433l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"1FcVJxxPWh4","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FcVJxxPWh4","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1FcVJxxPWh4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/1FcVJxxPWh4/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/1FcVJxxPWh4/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/1FcVJxxPWh4/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/1FcVJxxPWh4/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/1FcVJxxPWh4/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Fragrant Flowers Bloom with Dignity"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"薫る花は凛と咲く"},{"type":"English","title":"The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity"}],"title":"Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku","title_english":"The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity","title_japanese":"薫る花は凛と咲く","title_synonyms":["The Fragrant Flowers Bloom with Dignity"],"type":"TV","source":"Web manga","episodes":13,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2025-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2025-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":7,"year":2025},"to":{"day":28,"month":9,"year":2025}},"string":"Jul 6, 2025 to Sep 28, 2025"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.73,"scored_by":31627,"rank":49,"popularity":1188,"members":226598,"favorites":2978,"synopsis":"Despite being adjacent to one another, Chidori Public High School and the all-girls Kikyo Private Academy seem to exist in two different worlds. While the latter boasts an immaculate reputation and favors students from wealthy backgrounds, the former is a nest for dim-witted delinquents. Everyone at Kikyo harbors a deep hatred for their Chidori neighbors.\n\nSixteen-year-old Rintarou Tsumugi is a student at Chidori whose intimidating face leads people to avoid him. Rintarou pays no mind to this, as he is content with his group of friends. However, there is something he has not told them yet: sometimes, he helps out at his family's cake shop.\n\nOne day at work, Rintarou sees a customer at a table, but she runs off before he can talk to her. The next day, he receives an apology from the girl, Kaoruko Waguri, who explains that she did not run away because of his appearance and that she believes Rintarou is a kind-hearted person.

Ignoring the warnings from those around him, Rudo regularly rummages through the town's garbage in search of anything useful or valuable to save from the \"Abyss\"—a massive hole where anything considered trash is dumped, including people. Rudo's biological father was one such person, having been thrown into the Abyss after he was accused of murder.\n\nOne day, after running into a mysterious figure on the way home, Rudo returns to find Regto's dying body on the floor. He is immediately found at the scene by the authorities and is charged with murder. No one believes his claims of innocence, and he is thrown into the Abyss. Instead of dying, however, he finds himself in a strange, foul-smelling place surrounded by monsters made out of trash.\n\nWhen Rudo is attacked by said monsters, he is saved by a man named Enjin, who reveals himself to be a \"Cleaner\"—someone who uses special weapons called Vital Instruments to combat these creatures. In order to get his revenge on the one who killed Regto, Rudo reluctantly becomes a Cleaner to fight his way back up and out of the Abyss.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Gachiakuta aired on CBC and TBS' Agaru Anime block.","season":"summer","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"23:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 23:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Bones","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"},{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1542,"type":"anime","name":"DMM.com","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1542/DMMcom"},{"mal_id":1856,"type":"anime","name":"dugout","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1856/dugout"},{"mal_id":3155,"type":"anime","name":"Team-MAX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3155/Team-MAX"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":3045,"type":"anime","name":"Bones Film","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3045/Bones_Film"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":59192,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/59192/Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_Movie__Mugen_Jou-hen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1681/148216.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1681/148216t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1681/148216l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1681/148216.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1681/148216t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1681/148216l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"wPFeBxt7VXI","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPFeBxt7VXI","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wPFeBxt7VXI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/wPFeBxt7VXI/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/wPFeBxt7VXI/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/wPFeBxt7VXI/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/wPFeBxt7VXI/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/wPFeBxt7VXI/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kimetsu no Yaiba Movie: Mugen Jou-hen"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"劇場版 鬼滅の刃 無限城編"},{"type":"English","title":"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle"}],"title":"Kimetsu no Yaiba Movie: Mugen Jou-hen","title_english":"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle","title_japanese":"劇場版 鬼滅の刃 無限城編","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":3,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2025-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":18,"month":7,"year":2025},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 18, 2025 to ?"},"duration":"2 hr 35 min per ep","rating":"R -

Suddenly, \"Hikaru\" reveals his true monstrous form and begs Yoshiki to keep it a secret, as he does not want to kill him.\n\nDespite his paranormal nature, \"Hikaru\" seems almost innocent, full of childlike wonder and eager to experience the summer heat, the countryside, and all kinds of other things in a human body for the first time.

Going with the flow here, however, means something very different. Ryou is immediately pitted against the wild lands he winds up in and the slew of deadly monsters that call the remote subcontinent home. You'd think he'd forget about taking it easy when he's stuck fighting for his life, but lucky for Ryou, he's naturally optimistic, clever, and blessed with the hidden \"Eternal Youth\" trait.

The Oni are careless, rash, and disorderly, while the Momotarou protect the human world from the uncontrollable Oni. Shiki Ichinose is a reckless and irresponsible teenager, aware of his defiance and even proud of his expulsion from school. Despite Shiki's rebellious attitude, his foster father, Tsuyoshi, cares about him deeply.\n\nTsuyoshi's selfless love is soon shown in an explosive incident when a Momotarou barges in looking for Shiki. As a Momotarou himself, Tsuyoshi has been hiding Shiki for years and keeping his Oni origins a secret even from him. As he gives up his life to save Shiki and confesses everything in his dying breath, Shiki's Oni blood awakens for the first time, transforming him into an unruly monster overflowing with rage and a thirst for revenge.\n\nShiki's momentary outburst attracts the attention of Naito Mudano, an Oni teacher at the Rakshasa Academy—an institution for young Oni in need of understanding and perfecting their powers. Before Shiki can avenge his father, he must learn to control his headstrong and impulsive nature and, above all, fight against his own demonic blood.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Tougen Anki aired on Nippon TV's Friday Anime Night block.","season":"summer","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":1003,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Television Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"},{"mal_id":1373,"type":"anime","name":"Akita Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1373/Akita_Shoten"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":101,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Hibari","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/101/Studio_Hibari"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":59095,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/59095/Tensei_shitara_Dainana_Ouji_Datta_node_Kimama_ni_Majutsu_wo_Kiwamemasu_2nd_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/149614.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/149614t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/149614l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/149614.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/149614t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1154/149614l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"_wN2sC9Pq1c","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wN2sC9Pq1c","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wN2sC9Pq1c?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_wN2sC9Pq1c/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_wN2sC9Pq1c/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_wN2sC9Pq1c/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_wN2sC9Pq1c/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/_wN2sC9Pq1c/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Tensei shitara Dainana Ouji Datta node, Kimama ni Majutsu wo Kiwamemasu 2nd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Dainanaoji"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"I Was Reincarnated as the 7th Prince"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"so I Will Perfect My Magic as I Please 2nd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"転生したら第七王子だったので、気ままに魔術を極めます 第2期"},{"type":"English","title":"I Was Reincarnated as the 7th Prince so I Can Take My Time Perfecting My Magical Ability Season 2"}],"title":"Tensei shitara Dainana Ouji Datta node, Kimama ni Majutsu wo Kiwamemasu 2nd Season","title_english":"I Was Reincarnated as the 7th Prince so I Can Take My Time Perfecting My Magical Ability Season 2","title_japanese":"転生したら第七王子だったので、気ままに魔術を極めます 第2期","title_synonyms":["Dainanaoji","I Was Reincarnated as the 7th Prince","so I Will Perfect My Magic as I Please 2nd Season"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":12,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2025-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2025-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":10,"month":7,"year":2025},"to":{"day":25,"month":9,"year":2025}},"string":"Jul 10, 2025 to Sep 25, 2025"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 -

However, in contrast to his mother, Yuu is completely talentless. Being seen as completely mediocre, he would have no chance of standing side by side with the three emperors of Saika Academy: the Mikadono sisters, Miwa, Nico, and Kazuki, who are each prodigies in shogi, martial arts, and performing arts, respectively.\n\nWith Subaru's friend agreeing to take her son in, Yuu aims to fulfill his mother's last wish to him, which is to build a happy family, after never being able to form a proper mother-son relationship due to their difference in talent. As it turns out, his mother's friend is actually the father of the Mikadono sisters! Keeping his mother's wish in mind, Yuu aims to build familial bonds with the siblings. However, due to their extreme focus on their respective specializations, they show little interest in opening themselves up not only to him, but to each other as well. Nonetheless, Yuu strives to continuously support the three prodigies, as his kindness and care restores the bond between the sisters.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"summer","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":306,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Capsule","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/306/Magic_Capsule"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1430,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"},{"mal_id":1501,"type":"anime","name":"JR East Marketing & Communications","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1501/JR_East_Marketing___Communications"},{"mal_id":1986,"type":"anime","name":"arma bianca","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1986/arma_bianca"},{"mal_id":2680,"type":"anime","name":"Sankyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2680/Sankyo_"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":132,"type":"anime","name":"P.A.

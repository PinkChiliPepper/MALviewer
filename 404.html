It is no surprise that their students clash with their differences.\n\nHaving a tall stature and fierce appearance, Chidori student Rintarou Tsumugi is often avoided by others despite his gentle heart. One day, while helping out at his family's patisserie, he meets a customer who, after a brief moment, runs away from him. The next day, the customer returns to apologize to Rintarou, introducing herself as the cheerful Kaoruko Waguri.\n\nAfter spending time with Kaoruko, Rintarou appreciates that she does not judge him based on his appearance and looks forward to when they will meet again.

Rudo's biological father was one such person, having been thrown into the Abyss after he was accused of murder.\n\nOne day, after running into a mysterious figure on the way home, Rudo returns to find Regto's dying body on the floor.

With this amazing skill, Monica Everett joins the Seven Sages as a hero who can defeat powerful dragons, such as the legendary black dragon, all on her own. However, the truth is that the Silent Witch developed chantless magic due to being too shy—preferring to live on a mountain top, far from society.\n\nHer secluded lifestyle changes, though, when a fellow sage tasks her to covertly defend the second prince, Felix Arc Ridill, from attempts on his life. Unfortunately, that means she will have to go undercover as a student at Serendia Academy. Between guard duty and her social anxiety, Monica is facing her most difficult mission to date.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"summer","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":213,"type":"anime","name":"Half H.P Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/213/Half_HP_Studio"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1587,"type":"anime","name":"Cygames","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1587/Cygames"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":418,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Gokumi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/418/Studio_Gokumi"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":60732,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/60732/Mizu_Zokusei_no_Mahoutsukai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1383/151072.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1383/151072t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1383/151072l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1383/151072.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1383/151072t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1383/151072l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"4E6zDMwB1rw","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E6zDMwB1rw","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4E6zDMwB1rw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4E6zDMwB1rw/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4E6zDMwB1rw/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4E6zDMwB1rw/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4E6zDMwB1rw/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/4E6zDMwB1rw/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Mizu Zokusei no Mahoutsukai"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Water Magician: The Central Provinces Arc"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Mizu Zokusei no Mahoutsukai Daiichibu: Chuuou Shokoku-hen"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"水属性の魔法使い"},{"type":"English","title":"The Water Magician"}],"title":"Mizu Zokusei no Mahoutsukai","title_english":"The Water Magician","title_japanese":"水属性の魔法使い","title_synonyms":["The Water Magician: The Central Provinces Arc","Mizu Zokusei no Mahoutsukai Daiichibu: Chuuou Shokoku-hen"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":null,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2025-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":7,"year":2025},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jul 4, 2025 to ?"},"duration":"24 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.15,"scored_by":18616,"rank":3721,"popularity":2222,"members":105285,"favorites":370,"synopsis":"After getting caught up in an accident, Ryou Mihara is reincarnated in the world of Phi as a water magician.

Unlike his mother, Yuu lacks any extraordinary talent whatsoever, much to the disappointment of those who knew her. Still, he transfers to her alma mater with one quiet promise in his heart: to fulfill her final wish that he build a true and happy family.\n\nIt just so happens that the Mikadono patriarch is also Subaru's longtime friend and benefactor, and he offers Yuu both a place to stay and a fresh start. Thrust into the lives of three estranged sisters who act cold toward him, Yuu may not be a genius himself, but the clumsy sincerity he brings might be what they all need to start anew.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"summer","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":306,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Capsule","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/306/Magic_Capsule"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1430,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"},{"mal_id":1501,"type":"anime","name":"JR East Marketing & Communications","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1501/JR_East_Marketing___Communications"},{"mal_id":1986,"type":"anime","name":"arma bianca","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1986/arma_bianca"},{"mal_id":2680,"type":"anime","name":"Sankyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2680/Sankyo_"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":132,"type":"anime","name":"P.A.

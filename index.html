Ignoring the warnings from those around him, Rudo regularly rummages through the town's garbage in search of anything useful or valuable to save from the \"Abyss\"—a massive hole where anything considered trash is dumped, including people. Rudo's biological father was one such person, having been thrown into the Abyss after he was accused of murder.\n\nOne day, after running into a mysterious figure on the way home, Rudo returns to find Regto's dying body on the floor. He is immediately found at the scene by the authorities and is charged with murder. No one believes his claims of innocence, and he is thrown into the Abyss. Instead of dying, however, he finds himself in a strange, foul-smelling place surrounded by monsters made out of trash.\n\nWhen Rudo is attacked by said monsters, he is saved by a man named Enjin, who reveals himself to be a \"Cleaner\"—someone who uses special weapons called Vital Instruments to combat these creatures. In order to get his revenge on the one who killed Regto, Rudo reluctantly becomes a Cleaner to fight his way back up and out of the Abyss.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Gachiakuta aired on CBC and TBS' Agaru Anime block.","season":"summer","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"23:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 23:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Bones","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"},{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1542,"type":"anime","name":"DMM.com","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1542/DMMcom"},{"mal_id":1856,"type":"anime","name":"dugout","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1856/dugout"},{"mal_id":3155,"type":"anime","name":"Team-MAX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3155/Team-MAX"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":3045,"type":"anime","name":"Bones Film","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3045/Bones_Film"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":59177,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/59177/Kaijuu_8-gou_2nd_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1177/150344.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1177/150344t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1177/150344l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1177/150344.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1177/150344t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1177/150344l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"1ry0cE8Gr0k","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ry0cE8Gr0k","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ry0cE8Gr0k?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/1ry0cE8Gr0k/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/1ry0cE8Gr0k/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/1ry0cE8Gr0k/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/1ry0cE8Gr0k/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/1ry0cE8Gr0k/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Kaijuu 8-gou 2nd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"8Kaijuu"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Monster #8"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Kaiju No. Eight"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Kaiju #8"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"怪獣8号 第2期"},{"type":"English","title":"Kaiju No. 8 Season 2"}],"title":"Kaijuu 8-gou 2nd Season","title_english":"Kaiju No. 8 Season 2","title_japanese":"怪獣8号 第2期","title_synonyms":["8Kaijuu","Monster #8","Kaiju No. Eight","Kaiju #8"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":11,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2025-07-19T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2025-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":19,"month":7,"year":2025},"to":{"day":27,"month":9,"year":2025}},"string":"Jul 19, 2025 to Sep 27, 2025"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.87,"scored_by":28335,"rank":910,"popularity":1081,"members":249019,"favorites":1218,"synopsis":"Following the massive operation that led to the confinement of recent recruit Kafka Hibino, otherwise known as Kaijuu No. 8, the Defense Force has been puzzled by how to deal with him. Kafka is the first kaijuu to side with humans, and after careful consideration, he is eventually transferred to the Defense Force's First Division in the hope of adding his power to the strongest division, capable of handling any threat. However, some people are still doubtful about Kafka, and he must prove his worth in the next mission.\n\nKafka and the First Division are soon dispatched when a massive horde of ant-like kaijuu begins wreaking havoc. Thanks to the combined strength of Kafka's friend Kikoru Shinomiya and their captain, Gen Narumi, the mission seems to progress as it should. However, when Kafka fails to transform into his kaijuu form, the dreadful Kaijuu No. 9 joins the battle with only one goal—to eliminate him and steal his power. Although the situation is looking grim, Kafka must overcome his most difficult trial yet with the others if he wants to keep pursuing his dream: fighting side by side with his childhood friend and Third Division captain, Mina Ashiro.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"summer","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":47,"type":"anime","name":"Khara","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/47/Khara"},{"mal_id":323,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Columbia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":1858,"type":"anime","name":"Sonilude","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1858/Sonilude"},{"mal_id":2229,"type":"anime","name":"Toho Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2229/Toho_Music"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":82,"type":"anime","name":"Urban Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/82/Urban_Fantasy"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":58913,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/58913/Hikaru_ga_Shinda_Natsu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1104/148614.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1104/148614t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1104/148614l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1104/148614.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1104/148614t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1104/148614l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"sFaO07LwAVg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFaO07LwAVg","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sFaO07LwAVg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/sFaO07LwAVg/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/sFaO07LwAVg/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/sFaO07LwAVg/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/sFaO07LwAVg/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/sFaO07LwAVg/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Hikanatsu"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"光が死んだ夏"},{"type":"English","title":"The Summer Hikaru Died"}],"title":"Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu","title_english":"The Summer Hikaru Died","title_japanese":"光が死んだ夏","title_synonyms":["Hikanatsu"],"type":"TV","source":"Web manga","episodes":12,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2025-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2025-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":7,"year":2025},"to":{"day":28,"month":9,"year":2025}},"string":"Jul 6, 2025 to Sep 28, 2025"},"duration":"22 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.15,"scored_by":26948,"rank":479,"popularity":1372,"members":193666,"favorites":1681,"synopsis":"It has been six months since Yoshiki Tsujinaka's best friend, Hikaru Indou, went missing in the mountains and returned a week later with no recollection of what had transpired.

As the inmates begin wreaking havoc, Sakamoto and his allies must remain vigilant for the sake of everything they hold dear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"summer","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":73,"type":"anime","name":"TMS Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/73/TMS_Entertainment"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":68,"type":"anime","name":"Organized Crime","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/68/Organized_Crime"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":57433,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/57433/Seishun_Buta_Yarou_wa_Santa_Claus_no_Yume_wo_Minai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1823/149858.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1823/149858t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1823/149858l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1823/149858.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1823/149858t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1823/149858l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"H6TPUB0OvyM","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6TPUB0OvyM","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H6TPUB0OvyM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/H6TPUB0OvyM/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/H6TPUB0OvyM/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/H6TPUB0OvyM/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/H6TPUB0OvyM/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/H6TPUB0OvyM/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Seishun Buta Yarou: Daigakusei-hen"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"青春ブタ野郎はサンタクロースの夢を見ない"},{"type":"English","title":"Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus"}],"title":"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai","title_english":"Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus","title_japanese":"青春ブタ野郎はサンタクロースの夢を見ない","title_synonyms":["Seishun Buta Yarou: Daigakusei-hen"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":13,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"2025-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2025-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":7,"year":2025},"to":{"day":27,"month":9,"year":2025}},"string":"Jul 5, 2025 to Sep 27, 2025"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.24,"scored_by":15114,"rank":358,"popularity":1662,"members":154918,"favorites":775,"synopsis":"After surviving the entrance exams, Sakuta Azusagawa has finally enrolled in the same university as his girlfriend, Mai Sakurajima.

While preparing to perform surgery on someone, he gets a call from the hospital director telling him to switch patients and instead perform life-saving brain surgery on a famous performer. His fellow doctors, fiancée, and the hospital director applaud his accomplishment; but because of the switch, a poor immigrant worker is dead, causing Dr. Tenma to have a crisis of conscience.\n\nSo when a similar situation arises, Dr. Tenma stands his ground and chooses to perform surgery on the young boy Johan Liebert instead of the town's mayor. Unfortunately, this choice leads to serious ramifications for Dr. Tenma—losing his social standing being one of them. However, with the mysterious death of the director and two other doctors, Dr. Tenma's position is restored. With no evidence to convict him, he is released and goes on to attain the position of hospital director. \n\nNine years later when Dr. Tenma saves the life of a criminal, his past comes back to haunt him—once again, he comes face to face with the monster he operated on.

Though they face an army of monsters beyond anything they could have previously imagined, Mikasa, Armin, and their allies stand brave in the face of certain doom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season - Kanketsu-hen adapts content from volumes 32-34 of the original manga.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"},{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1499,"type":"anime","name":"Techno Sound","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1499/Techno_Sound"},{"mal_id":1557,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon Enterprises","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1557/Pony_Canyon_Enterprises"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":569,"type":"anime","name":"MAPPA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"},{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Survival","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/76/Survival"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":35247,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/35247/Owarimonogatari_2nd_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/87322.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/87322t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/87322l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/87322.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/87322t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/87322l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"7WdyIcDlK2o","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WdyIcDlK2o","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7WdyIcDlK2o?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7WdyIcDlK2o/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7WdyIcDlK2o/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7WdyIcDlK2o/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7WdyIcDlK2o/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/7WdyIcDlK2o/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Owarimonogatari 2nd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"End Story 2nd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"終物語"},{"type":"English","title":"Owarimonogatari Second Season"},{"type":"French","title":"Owarimonogatari Saison 2"}],"title":"Owarimonogatari 2nd Season","title_english":"Owarimonogatari Second Season","title_japanese":"終物語","title_synonyms":["End Story 2nd Season"],"type":"TV Special","source":"Light novel","episodes":7,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2017-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":12,"month":8,"year":2017},"to":{"day":13,"month":8,"year":2017}},"string":"Aug 12, 2017 to Aug 13, 2017"},"duration":"22 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.86,"scored_by":205346,"rank":26,"popularity":596,"members":426609,"favorites":8963,"synopsis":"Following an encounter with oddity specialist Izuko Gaen, third-year high school student Koyomi Araragi wakes up in a strange, deserted void only to be greeted by a joyfully familiar face in an alarmingly unfamiliar place.  \n\nAraragi, with the help of his girlfriend Hitagi Senjougahara, maneuvers through the webs of his past and the perplexities of the present in search of answers.

This was due to anime censorship having increased following the big controversies over Evangelion, as a result most of the series was pulled from the air due to violent content. Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall. Protagonist Spike Spiegel won Best Male Character, and Megumi Hayashibara won Best Voice Actor for her role as Faye Valentine in the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix, respectively. Cowboy Bebop's biggest influence has been in the United States, where it premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since.

The victor of the battle, the state of Qin, is no different. There, the political parties led by Ying Zheng and Buwei Lü continue their inner conflict. Having played the role of king in the coalition battle, Zheng has the trust of the people—but Lü is far from out of the fight. In 18 months, he plans to interrupt Zheng's coming-of-age ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, a Zhao army numbering 20,000 troops has set out toward Qin. In the royal court, due to the lack of generals capable of responding to the incoming threat, Lü slyly suggests that Zheng take command. However, Cheng Jiao, Zheng's half-brother, volunteers instead. As they grew to trust each other during the coalition battle, Zheng now accepts Jiao as his replacement.\n\nHowever, the Zhao forces retreat a mere half-day after clashing with Jiao's army.

Exuding unshakeable confidence, Satoru Gojou and Suguru Getou believe there is no challenge too great for young and powerful Special Grade sorcerers such as themselves. They are tasked with safely delivering a sensible girl named Riko Amanai to the entity whose existence is the very essence of the jujutsu world. However, the mission plunges them into an exhausting swirl of moral conflict that threatens to destroy the already feeble amity between sorcerers and ordinary humans.\n\nTwelve years later, students and sorcerers are the frontline defense against the rising number of high-level curses born from humans' negative emotions. As the entities grow in power, their self-awareness and ambition increase too. The curses unite for the common goal of eradicating humans and creating a world of only cursed energy users, led by a dangerous, ancient cursed spirit. To dispose of their greatest obstacle—the strongest sorcerer, Gojou—they orchestrate an attack at Shibuya Station on Halloween. Dividing into teams, the sorcerers enter the fight prepared to risk everything to protect the innocent and their own kind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Jujutsu Kaisen 2nd Season was released on Blu-ray and DVD in six volumes from October 18, 2023, to May 22, 2024.","season":"summer","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"23:56","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 23:56 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":1143,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":1856,"type":"anime","name":"dugout","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1856/dugout"},{"mal_id":2260,"type":"anime","name":"Sumzap","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2260/Sumzap"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":569,"type":"anime","name":"MAPPA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":21,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/21/One_Piece","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1244/138851l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"-tviZNY6CSw","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tviZNY6CSw","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-tviZNY6CSw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-tviZNY6CSw/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-tviZNY6CSw/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-tviZNY6CSw/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-tviZNY6CSw/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/-tviZNY6CSw/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"One Piece"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"OP"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ONE PIECE"},{"type":"English","title":"One Piece"}],"title":"One Piece","title_english":"One Piece","title_japanese":"ONE PIECE","title_synonyms":["OP"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":null,"status":"Currently Airing","airing":true,"aired":{"from":"1999-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":20,"month":10,"year":1999},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Oct 20, 1999 to ?"},"duration":"24 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.73,"scored_by":1465401,"rank":52,"popularity":17,"members":2575163,"favorites":242665,"synopsis":"Barely surviving in a barrel after passing through a terrible whirlpool at sea, carefree Monkey D.

The travelling Mushishi, Ginko, persists in trying to set right the strange and unsettling situations he encounters. Time loops, living shadows, and telepathy are among the overt effects of interference from Mushi, but more subtle symptoms that take years to be noticed also rouse Ginko's concern as he passes from village to village.\n\nThrough circumstance, Ginko has become an arbiter, determining which Mushi are blessings and which are curses. But the lines that he seeks to draw are subjective. Some of his patients would rather exercise their new powers until they are utterly consumed by them; others desperately strive to rid themselves of afflictions which are in fact protecting their lives from devastation. Those who cross paths with Mushi must learn to accept seemingly impossible consequences for their actions, and heal wounds they did not know they had. Otherwise, they risk meeting with fates beyond their comprehension.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"fall","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":711,"type":"anime","name":"Delfi Sound","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/711/Delfi_Sound"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Artland","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/8/Artland"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"},{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":45649,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/45649/The_First_Slam_Dunk","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1745/129284.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1745/129284t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1745/129284l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1745/129284.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1745/129284t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1745/129284l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"9o7-Cgetho4","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o7-Cgetho4","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9o7-Cgetho4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9o7-Cgetho4/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9o7-Cgetho4/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9o7-Cgetho4/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9o7-Cgetho4/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/9o7-Cgetho4/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"The First Slam Dunk"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"THE FIRST SLAM DUNK"}],"title":"The First Slam Dunk","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"THE FIRST SLAM DUNK","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2022-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":3,"month":12,"year":2022},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Dec 3, 2022"},"duration":"2 hr 4 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.72,"scored_by":31799,"rank":56,"popularity":2884,"members":69264,"favorites":982,"synopsis":"Shohoku's \"speedster\" and point guard, Ryouta Miyagi, always plays with brains and lightning speed, running circles around his opponents while feigning composure.

However, an encounter with a mysterious man upends Rafal's life, sparking an illogical desire to instead pursue his passion for astronomy.\n\nRafal is determined to prove the beauty and rationality of heliocentrism—the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun. This belief is considered heretical by the powerful Church, which promotes geocentrism—the Sun revolving around the Earth—as the sole truth of the universe. Those whose beliefs do not align with the will of the Church suffer unfathomably gruesome consequences.\n\nIn pursuit of evidence for a heliocentric model of the universe, Rafal grapples with obtaining precise calculations and building empirical theories.

This isn't because of a passion for teaching, but because he wants a loving teenage wife when he's old and gray. Still, for a perverted, greedy, and lazy delinquent, there is more to Onizuka than meets the eye. So when he lands a job as the homeroom teacher of the Class 3-4 at the prestigious Holy Forest Academy—despite suplexing the Vice Principal—all of his talents are put to the test, as this class is particularly infamous.\n\nDue to their utter contempt for all teachers, the class' students use psychological warfare to mentally break any new homeroom teacher they get, forcing them to quit and leave school. However, Onizuka isn't your average teacher, and he's ready for any challenge in his way.\n\nBullying, suicide, and sexual harassment are just a few of the issues his students face daily. By tackling the roots of their problems, Onizuka supports them with his unpredictable and unconventional methods—even if it means jumping off a building to save a suicidal child. Thanks to his eccentric charm and fun-loving nature, Class 3-4 slowly learns just how enjoyable school can be when you're the pupils of the Great Teacher Onizuka.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"First episode has a duration of 48 minutes, standard length is 24 minutes.","season":"summer","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"19:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 19:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"},{"mal_id":484,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyopop","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/484/Tokyopop"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Studio_Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"Delinquents","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/55/Delinquents"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"},{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"Workplace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":40434,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/40434/Mo_Dao_Zu_Shi__Wanjie_Pian","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1634/116782.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1634/116782t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1634/116782l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1634/116782.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1634/116782t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1634/116782l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"YsA1hKfRqtQ","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsA1hKfRqtQ","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YsA1hKfRqtQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YsA1hKfRqtQ/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YsA1hKfRqtQ/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YsA1hKfRqtQ/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YsA1hKfRqtQ/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/YsA1hKfRqtQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Mo Dao Zu Shi: Wanjie Pian"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation 3"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Founder of Diabolism 3"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Mo Dao Zu Shi 3rd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Mo Dao Zu Shi Final Arc"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"魔道祖师 完结篇"},{"type":"English","title":"The Master of Diabolism 3"}],"title":"Mo Dao Zu Shi: Wanjie Pian","title_english":"The Master of Diabolism 3","title_japanese":"魔道祖师 完结篇","title_synonyms":["Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation 3","The Founder of Diabolism 3","Mo Dao Zu Shi 3rd Season","Mo Dao Zu Shi Final Arc"],"type":"ONA","source":"Web novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2021-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2021-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":8,"year":2021},"to":{"day":16,"month":10,"year":2021}},"string":"Aug 7, 2021 to Oct 16, 2021"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.68,"scored_by":33249,"rank":68,"popularity":2412,"members":92827,"favorites":1700,"synopsis":"Along an empty road in the rural countryside, Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji stumble across a stone plaque that reads \"Yi City.\" Still on their quest to unravel the mystery behind the cursed severed arm, they venture into the deserted city to obtain further leads.\n\nHowever, with the appearance of a mysterious new cultivator, the demonic arm investigation leads Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji to a plot that threatens the cultivation world as they know it.

Even so, Riko has a chance encounter with a mysterious robot with the appearance of an ordinary young boy. She comes to name him Reg, and he has no recollection of the events preceding his discovery. Certain that the technology to create Reg must come from deep within the Abyss, the two decide to venture forth into the chasm to recover his memories and see the bottom of the great pit with their own eyes. However, they know not of the harsh reality that is the true existence of the Abyss.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The first season adapts the first three manga volumes in their entirety, and it concludes with the first chapter of the manga's fourth volume.","season":"summer","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"21:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 21:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":332,"type":"anime","name":"Takeshobo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/332/Takeshobo"},{"mal_id":737,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Communications","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/737/Sony_Music_Communications"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1587,"type":"anime","name":"Cygames","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1587/Cygames"},{"mal_id":1677,"type":"anime","name":"Kanetsu Investment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1677/Kanetsu_Investment"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":2095,"type":"anime","name":"Global Solutions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2095/Global_Solutions"},{"mal_id":2369,"type":"anime","name":"IRMA LA DOUCE","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2369/IRMA_LA_DOUCE"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":290,"type":"anime","name":"Kinema Citrus","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/290/Kinema_Citrus"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":11665,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/11665/Natsume_Yuujinchou_Shi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/37449.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/37449t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/37449l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/37449.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/37449t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/37449l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"n_Ku789_xVo","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Ku789_xVo","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_Ku789_xVo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/n_Ku789_xVo/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/n_Ku789_xVo/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/n_Ku789_xVo/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/n_Ku789_xVo/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/n_Ku789_xVo/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Natsume Yuujinchou Shi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Natsume Yuujinchou Four"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Natsume Yuujinchou 4"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Natsume Yujincho 4"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"夏目友人帳 肆"},{"type":"English","title":"Natsume's Book of Friends Season 4"},{"type":"German","title":"Natsume Yujin-cho Staffel 4"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Natsume Yujin-cho Temporada 4"},{"type":"French","title":"Natsume Yujin-cho Saison 4"}],"title":"Natsume Yuujinchou Shi","title_english":"Natsume's Book of Friends Season 4","title_japanese":"夏目友人帳 肆","title_synonyms":["Natsume Yuujinchou Four","Natsume Yuujinchou 4","Natsume Yujincho 4"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2012-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2012-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":3,"month":1,"year":2012},"to":{"day":27,"month":3,"year":2012}},"string":"Jan 3, 2012 to Mar 27, 2012"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.63,"scored_by":115383,"rank":91,"popularity":1033,"members":261280,"favorites":2095,"synopsis":"Takashi Natsume, the timid youkai expert and master of the Book of Friends, continues his journey towards self-understanding and acceptance with the help of friends both new and old.

Although the overly confident Peco strives to be the best ping-pong player in the world, he often skips practice, earning the ire of his fellow teammates on the Katase High School ping-pong team. Meanwhile, Smile—in spite of his innate talent for the sport—cannot help but hold back his full strength when playing against others. Through their mutual love for ping-pong, the two have developed a bond that is seemingly unbreakable.\n\nWhen Peco hears that an ex-national team player from China is coming to Japan, he drags Smile over to rival Tsujido High School to observe them. The subsequent trip leads to a clash between Peco and Kong Wenge, who overwhelmingly defeats the former in one game. Stunned by such a comprehensive loss, Peco finds himself questioning why he plays to begin with. Seeing his potential as a player, Katase's coach begins to train Smile to overcome his hesitation, but he is reluctant to play if it is not for enjoyment.\n\nAs the two struggle to find meaning in the sport, a plethora of stronger players—each with their own internal strifes—await them at the inter-high tournament, where only the very best can persevere. But when these young athletes let their unbridled ambition go unchecked, the hardships they face paint a somber reality as they pursue glory.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Ping Pong The Animation won the Animation of the Year award in the Television category at the Tokyo Anime Award Festival in 2015.

However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls.

Jou Kitahara, a rookie trainer with big dreams and modest expectations, does not expect to find talent in the quiet town of Kasamatsu—until he meets an ash-gray-haired girl with a wild, unconventional stride.\n\nAs a child with bad knees, Oguri Cap spent much of her early life in pain, struggling to stand. But through relentless perseverance, she overcame her limits and found liberation in the very thing that once seemed impossible: running. While the other horse girls at Kasamatsu chase victory and fame, Oguri runs without ambition, driven only by the joy of movement.\n\nFujimasa March, a rising regional star, commands attention with her discipline, talent, and tenacity. For her, running is a matter of pride. But when a school-organized race brings her face-to-face with Oguri's raw, unpolished stride, March's confidence begins to waver. In turn, something in Oguri shifts after racing March. For the first time, a spark of ambition ignites within her—a desire to win that will take her beyond the confines of her hometown to the grand stages waiting on the horizon.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Uma Musume: Cinderella Gray was released on Blu-ray in four volumes from September 17, 2025, to December 17, 2025.","season":"spring","year":2025,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"16:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 16:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"},{"mal_id":1397,"type":"anime","name":"Universal Music Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1397/Universal_Music_Japan"},{"mal_id":1587,"type":"anime","name":"Cygames","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1587/Cygames"},{"mal_id":2074,"type":"anime","name":"Bit grooove promotion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion"},{"mal_id":2751,"type":"anime","name":"Happinet Media Marketing","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2751/Happinet_Media_Marketing"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":3103,"type":"anime","name":"REMOW","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3103/REMOW"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1893,"type":"anime","name":"CygamesPictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1893/CygamesPictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Anthropomorphic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"},{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Racing","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}]},"h":{},"s":200,"st":"OK","u":"https://api.jikan.moe/v4/top/anime?page=5","rt":"json"},"__nghData__":[{"t":{"7":"t0","8":"t1"},"c":{"7":[],"8":[{"i":"t1","r":2}]}},{},{"t":{"8":"t2","9":"t3"},"c":{"8":[],"9":[{"i":"t3","r":126,"t":{"1":"t4"},"c":{"1":[{"i":"t4","r":1,"x":125}]}}]}},{"t":{"8":"t2","9":"t3"},"c":{"8":[],"9":[{"i":"t3","r":24,"t":{"1":"t4"},"c":{"1":[{"i":"t4","r":1,"x":23}]}}]}},{"c":{"3":[{"i":"c2053520834","r":1}]}},{"c":{"0":[{"i":"c2640512382","r":1}]}}]}</script></body></html>
